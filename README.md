# SpawnDeadZoneTweaks

Experimental mod for 7 Day to Die (Alpha 21) that forces sleeper volumes to spawn in sleepers within a certain range, even if the trigger is not yet activated. Intended to fix issues with pop-in spawning and clear quests failing to spawn in all zombies.

WARNING: This is an entirely experimental mod. Use at your own risk. May affect frame rates if it spawns in too many zombies at one time.

## Configuration

Mod options can be changed by editing Config.xml in the mod folder.

## Installation

Download source to your 7 Days to Die mod folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods).

This is a Harmony (C#) mod. EAC must be disabled.
